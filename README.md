# Recipe webpage -- Sweet&salty -- personal project
- Since I love baking and cooking, I have decided to make a small recipe webpage to show my knowledge in using HTML, CSS and Javascript as my first solo project, without help of premade youtube videos
using my own solo ideas and just searching and learning as I make the webpage.

## Overview

### The project

- I love cooking and baking! Second favourite thing to do, after taking long walks, reading books and of course, coding! That is why I have decided to make a small webpage that would consist of three recipes that I hold close to my heart.<br>
- Name of my webpage is <strong>Sweet&salty</strong> because it consists two salty and one sweet recipe. My idea was to show what I have learned by making a recipe webpages that would be informative and useful.<br>
- The idea is to have an interactive, normal, cooking webpage that will show you my favourite recipe while adding links to the other recipes you can find from the main webpages and authors.<br>
- It will have pictures of the process of the making and of the final dish. I will add the abilty to cross the ingredient that has been used, that the screen does not go dark when you are using my site (add a button for it),<br>
that you can change from European conversion to US conversion considering the ingredients.<br>
- My plan is to make it as interactive as possible, with a lot of easter eggs when clicking certain things on the webpage.
- There will be a <b>small quiz</b> that I will build using <strong>Javascript</strong> on the main, index web page.
- Will add a nutrition table within my Blackforest cake webpage.
