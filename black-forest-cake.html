<h1>Black Forest Cake</h1>

<p>When we talk about Germany and which dessert represents them, Black Forest Cake (or as its known in Germany - <i>“Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.”</i>) is the one to go with.
    <br>
    With layers of chocolate, at least four of them, light and fluffy whipped cream and sour/sweet cherries, there is not a single person that could resist such goodiness.
</p>
<p>The best time to make it is always, but lets keep it real, when the cherries get discounted, there is no better time to <br>
whip some good ol` cream and added chocolate base.</p>

<br>
<p>This is not for children! Well, it will not be if you do use the special ingredient, and that is <b>cherry liquor</b>.</p>
<p>After a good amount of time spent in the fridge, it will be ready to enjoy to the fullest!</p>
