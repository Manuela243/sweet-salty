<h1>Black Forest Cake</h1>

<p>When we talk about Germany and which dessert represents them, Black Forest Cake (or as its known in Germany - <i>“Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.”</i>) is the one to go with.
    <br>
    With layers of chocolate, at least four of them, light and fluffy whipped cream and sour/sweet cherries, there is not a single person that could resist such goodiness.
