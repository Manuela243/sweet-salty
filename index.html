    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>Since I love cooking and baking, I decided to showcase my skills into making a webpage that contains my favourite recipes.<br>
        I do hope you will enjoy the concept as much as the recipe themselves!
    </p>
    <p>In the inspiration section, I will acknowledge the authors of the recipes that influenced my work.</p>
    <p>All images that I have included in this project were obtained from external websites and are the property of their respective
    owners.</p>
    <p>Happy cooking!</p>

<!--WHAT I HAVE LEARNED-->
<!--I added label to be able to add input with checkbox as type to add a possibilty of interaction of the
user with my webpage-->
<!--To add a name to the list which is the <ul> I added a heading as <h> or you 
    can add a paragraph <p>-->
<!--To add semantic and to make a part of text important, even inside the heading, use <strong>,
    not only will it bold the text, but it will make it seem important to the search engines and other tools
    and its good for SEO and accessibility-->
<!--What does it actually mean "staged" (waiting in local repository) and "push" (sent to remote repository like GitHub) 
when it comes to commit inside the VSC-->


<!--TODO add * and make it border-box for easier manipulation with elements sizes, CSS-->
<!--TODO add in the main style.css for all images to be the same size, BUT add for
main pictures to be bigger and curvy-->
